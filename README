How to set up the server

1. create a folder for your project for example my-app
2. copy "flask-backend" folder in my-app
3. go back to my-app folder and use console command "npm install yarn"
4. after that use console command "yarn add create-react-app react-scripts"
5. next we need to create virtual environmet for python, for that we use "python -m venv venv" command
6. activate your virtual environment via command ". venv/bin/activate"
7. install python libraries we need via command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
8. after that lets get back to our front end, go to my-app folder and execute "npm create-react-app react-frontend"
9. go to new folder via "cd react-frontend" command
10. run "npm run eject"
11. copy 'config' and 'src' folders from the attachments to the react-frontend folder
12. then run "yarn add @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx"
13. finally run "npm run build" 
14. now everything is ready to start the flask server! Go to flask-backend folder and run "python main.py"
15. now on localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000/ you will see running server
